Using 2D UNet to segment the HipMRI Study on Prostate Cancer dataset

Task Description from Blackboard: "Segment the HipMRI Study on Prostate Cancer (see Appendix for link) 
using the processed 2D slices (2D images) available here with the 2D UNet [1] with all labels having a
minimum Dice similarity coefficient of 0.75 on the test set on the prostate label. You will need to load 
Nifti file format and sample code is provided in Appendix B. [Easy Difficulty]"

An initial test code was run to just visualise one of the slices before using 2D UNet to get a sense of 
what the images look like. The resuling image afer test.py was run can be seen in Figure_1.png.
